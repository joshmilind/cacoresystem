# This is the configuration file for LexGrid based applications.  Each 
# option in this file is described just before the option.  Any line that 
# starts with a '#' sign is treated as a comment, and is completely ignored 
# by the application.  Due to the way that this file is processed - whenever
# you want to create a '\' character, you need to use two '\'.   For example
# the following paths are valid:
# C:\\temp\\foo\\
# C:/temp/foo/
# This path is _NOT_ valid.
# C:\temp\foo
#
#
# The LexGrid system attempts to automatically locate this file when it is 
# started as follows:
#
# It determines the folder that the LexGrid classes are located (either in 
# a jar file, or a folder containing class files).  For this example, lets assume
# that the jar file containing LexGrid was found at 'C:\LexGrid\LexBIG\lib\lbRuntime.jar'
# Then the path it starts with will be 'C:\LexGrid\LexBIG\lib\'.  Lets call this 
# location 'A'.  Starting from location A, it checks for the following sub-path: 
# 'resources\config\config.props'.  Lets call this path 'B'.  If a file exists 
# 'A\B', the search is over.  If this file is not found - it goes up one directory
# from A, and checks for B again.  So, now it is checking "A\..\B". - which is
# 'C:\LexGrid\LexBIG\resources\config\config.props'.  This process continues until 
# it finds the file, reaches the root of the file system, or it has gone up 10 levels.
# At that point, it quits and and the starup fails.

# The auto search can be overridden by setting the System Variable 'LG_CONFIG_FILE'
# to the full absolute path of the config.props file.  For example - if you were 
# starting from the command line, you could add this parameter to the java 
# command to set the 'System Property' to the folder 
# 'C:\LexGrid\LexBIG\resources\config\config.props': 
# -DLG_CONFIG_FILE="C:\LexGrid\LexBIG\resources\config\config.props"

############# System variables

# Enable LVG Normalization for indexing / querying.
# Changing this from false to true requires a full re-index.
#
# NOTE: It is not recommended to enable this setting in
# for nodes serving large vocabularies such as the
# NCI MetaThesaurus due to the increased time and resources
# required to build the index.
NORMALIZED_QUERIES_ENABLED=false

# Path to the LVG config file (ignored if normalized
# queries are not enabled).
LVG_NORM_CONFIG_FILE_ABSOLUTE=\\\\mir04\\LargeData\\LargeInstallers\\lvg2005Portable\\lvg2005\\data\\config\\lvg.properties

# Size of the Dynamic Cache (this is used to cache frequently
# accessed information)
CACHE_SIZE=500

# Length of idle time before invalidating Iterators (in minutes)
ITERATOR_IDLE_TIME=5

# Max number of results that can be returned at once by
# any query operation.  This corresponds to the maximum size
# of the lists that are returned by Resolve calls.
#
# NOTE: This does not affect the total number of results
# that can be returned by an iterator, just the size that
# can be returned per 'next' call.
MAX_RESULT_SIZE=1000

# The location to use as the starting point for resolving all other relative
# paths in this configuration file.  This variable is optional.  If you do 
# not set this variable it will default to the location of the config.props
# file - this file - when the system starts up.  This value can be overridden
# by setting the 'System Property' 'LG_BASE_PATH'.  For example - if you were 
# starting from the command line, you could add this parameter to the java 
# command to set the 'System Property' to the folder 'C:/lb':
# -DLG_BASE_PATH="c:\lb"
#LINUX CONFIG
LG_BASE_PATH=/usr/local/jboss-4.0.2/server/ncicb-core/data/lb
#WINDOWS CONFIG
#LG_BASE_PATH=C:/jboss-4.0.2/server/default/data/lb

############# Database Configuration


# When SINGLE_DB_MODE is set to false, a new database will be created 
# for each loaded terminology.  When SINGLE_DB_MODE is set to true, 
# a new set of tables (with a unique prefix) will be created for 
# each loaded terminology.  All terminologies will be held inside 
# the same physical database.
#
# NOTE: This value should typically not be changed once content has
# been loaded.  If a change is required, it is recommended that all
# coding schemes be removed and the resource registry (xml file in
# the same directory as this config) be deleted prior to the change.

# This is the address of the database server that will be used

######  READ THE NEXT LINES CAREFULLY!  ######
# If you have set 'SINGLE_DB_MODE' to 'true', then this variable 
# _should_ contain the database name.
#
# If you have set 'SINGLE_DB_MODE' to 'false', then this variable 
# _should NOT_ contain the database name. Instead, it should end 
# at the end of the server address plus whatever character seperates 
# the server name from the database name.

# Indicates when a new log file should be started.
# This can be a one of the following:

LOG_CHANGE=5

# Controls automated cleanup of log files.
